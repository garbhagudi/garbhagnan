          India is about to reach the replacement ration in the next 20 years
          and our population will stabilize by then or it may also start
          dropping. Infertility will become a major cause of concern then. In
          order to prevent such a catastrophe, it is required to conduct these
          fertility screening camps for all men and women who are in the
          fertility period.
