            Sneha Rao: I visited the flower show at Lalbagh. I had my
            5-month-old baby with me. Thanks to the feeding booth sponsored by
            GarbhaGudi, I was able to feed my baby in privacy.

            Anushka Kamath: Thanks to GarbhaGudi for organizing a feeding booth
            where I could feed my 8-months-old baby. The ambience of the feeding
            booth was pleasant, comforting and our privacy was maintained.

          <p className="pt-4">
            Sushma Kanthimath: I was so relieved when I got to know about the
            feeding booth. I was at the flower show with my 6-months-old baby
            when my baby suddenly started crying. The security then suggested
            the available feeding booth. We felt comforted and relaxed as we
            used the feeding booth. Thanks to GarbhaGudi.
